## Background
Organizations are looking for a way to develop and deploy applications on open hybrid cloud in a stable, simple, and secure way. This hybrid approach includes multi-cloud deployments where workloads may be running on different clusters on different clouds - private or public. This also requires an infrastructutre-as-code approach that manages versions and being able to deploy based on specific deloyment configurations. 

The pattern is derived from work done by the [Red Hat Portfolio Architecture team](https://gitlab.com/redhatdemocentral/portfolio-architecture-examples/-/blob/main/spi-multi-cloud-gitops.adoc)

### Solution elements

- How to use a GitOps approach to manage multiple cloud dpeloyments in both public and private clouds.
- How to centrally manage multiple clusters, including workloads.
- How to securely manage secrets across multi-cloud deployments.

### Red Hat Technologies

- Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform (Kubernetes++)
- Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management (Open Cluster Management)
- Red Hat OpenShift GitOps (ArgoCD)
- Hasicorp Vault
- [TBD]

## Architecture
At a high level this requires a management hub, for DevOps and GitOps, and and infrastructure that extends to more than one managed clusters running on private or public clouds.

## Recorded Demo

## What Next
- [Deploy the management hub](getting-started)  using Helm 
- Add a managed cluster to [deploy the  managed cluster piece using ACM](managed cluster)
